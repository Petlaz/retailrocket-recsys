    "## Step 6 - Documentation Outline with Example Content\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "* Goal: Build and evaluate recommender system models on RetailRocket dataset, including popularity-based, content-based, and collaborative filtering (KNN).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Dataset: RetailRocket e-commerce user interactions (clicks, carts, orders).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Methods: Popularity baseline, item-based content similarity, and user-item KNN collaborative filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Evaluation Metrics: Precision@K, Recall@K, MAP, NDCG on a user-wise train/test split.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Processing Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "* Raw Data: Loaded from CSV logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Filtering: Removed low-activity users and items.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Splitting: User-wise train/test split to avoid data leakage.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Feature Engineering: Encoded categorical features, created user-item sparse matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Artifacts: Stored filtered data, item embeddings, and models under /data/processed and /artifacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modeling Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "* Popularity Model: Ranked items by overall popularity in training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Content-Based Filtering: Used precomputed item-item similarity matrix from item features.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Collaborative Filtering (KNN): Built sparse user-item matrix; tuned number of neighbors, algorithm, and distance metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hyperparameter Tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explored grid for KNN parameters: n_neighbors, algorithm (auto, brute), metric (cosine, euclidean).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Selected best model based on MAP on held-out users.\n",

    "## Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add real-time updating of user profiles for dynamic recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Experiment with deep learning models (e.g., neural collaborative filtering).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implement cold-start strategies for new users/items.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explore session-based recommenders or transformer architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This project successfully developed a scalable and effective recommender system leveraging real-world RetailRocket e-commerce data. Through systematic implementation and evaluation of popularity-based, content-based, and collaborative filtering models, the tuned KNN collaborative filtering approach demonstrated the highest recommendation quality, achieving nearly 20x improvement in MAP over the baseline.\n",
    "\n",
    "The modular pipeline, combined with rigorous offline evaluation metrics, establishes a strong foundation for further enhancements such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Incorporating deep learning-based recommenders\n",
    "\n",
    "* Real-time user interaction feedback loops\n",
    "\n",
    "* Online A/B testing in production settings\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this work showcases practical skills in data preprocessing, model building, hyperparameter tuning, and performance assessment, directly applicable to industry-scale recommendation problems.\n",
